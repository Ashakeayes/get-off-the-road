This week was just adding the finishing touches
(please see image of how i coded in the images folder under week 13)
I added in a countdownt timer and score so the player passes a different score every 15 seconds it goes up by 1 
I also decided to add in a rain sprite as we all know syd drivers really cant drive in the rain. it progressively gets worse as they climb up the levels.
